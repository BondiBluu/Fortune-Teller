  response: "Hi, Fortune Teller, \r\n\r\nI hate to admit it, but you\u2019re speaking
    to me right now. I\u2019m trying my best with the kids I teach, but the world\u2019s
    deeply poisoned. I guess it\u2019s only a matter of time before they grow up
    just like the other awful people in the world. What\u2019s the point then? \r\nI
    really need to think. I think I\u2019ll cancel class today\u2026\r\n\r\nThanks\u2026\r\n"
