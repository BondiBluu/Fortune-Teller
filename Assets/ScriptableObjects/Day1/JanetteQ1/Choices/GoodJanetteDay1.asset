  response: "Hi, Fortune Teller, \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been thinking about your answer
    a lot lately. People are growing at their own pace, and learning comes differently
    to different people - just like the children I teach. Learning doesn\u2019t stop
    after school ends, and I feel silly for forgetting that, as a teacher. \r\n\r\nI
    feel motivated! Thanks a lot!\r\n"
